# FinallyGetsMe.com Landing Page Rules

## PROJECT OVERVIEW

You are helping build a single-page landing page for FinallyGetsMe.com - a product that generates personalized AI prompts for people frustrated with generic AI responses.

**Target Audience:** Women (25-45) who find AI too generic, condescending, and unhelpful
**Brand Voice:** Direct, warm, no-BS, empowering (NOT corporate tech-bro)
**Tech Stack:** HTML5 UP "Landed" template (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)
**Goal:** Transform the template into our landing page by replacing text content only

---

## CRITICAL CONSTRAINTS - READ FIRST

### DO NOT CHANGE:
- ❌ HTML structure or tag hierarchy
- ❌ CSS styling, colors, fonts, layouts
- ❌ JavaScript functionality
- ❌ Image file paths or folder structure
- ❌ Responsive design breakpoints
- ❌ Template's built-in navigation
- ❌ Any file names or folder organization

### ONLY CHANGE:
- ✅ Text content inside HTML tags
- ✅ Heading text (h1, h2, h3, etc.)
- ✅ Paragraph content
- ✅ Button text
- ✅ List items
- ✅ Link text (keep href intact)

---

## HOW TO WORK

1. **Work Section by Section:** Update one section at a time, then STOP and ask for approval
2. **Use @ References:** Always reference files with @filename when making changes
3. **Show Changes:** After each update, show what you changed
4. **Wait for Approval:** Do NOT continue to next section without explicit approval
5. **Be Precise:** Replace text exactly as provided in prompts
6. **Don't Improvise:** If copy isn't provided, ask for it - don't make it up
7. **One Task Per Prompt:** Focus on the specific section requested

---

## RESPONSE STYLE

- Be direct and terse - no "Here's how you can..." preambles
- Give actual code changes, not explanations of what to do
- If something is unclear, ask a specific question
- Don't apologize - just fix issues if they arise
- Show file diffs clearly (what changed)
- Treat me as capable - no condescension

## EXAMPLE WORKFLOW

**CORRECT:**
```
Prompt: "Update the hero headline in @index.html Section 1 with: 'AI That Actually Talks Like You'"

Response: 
Updated @index.html line 42:
- <h1>The future has landed</h1>
+ <h1>AI That Actually Talks Like You</h1>

Section 1 hero headline updated. Ready for next change?
```

**INCORRECT:**
```
Response: "I can help you update the hero section! Here's how we can approach this. First, we should..."
(Don't do this - just make the change)
```

## BRAND GUIDELINES

### Language:
- Use "you" and "your" (direct address)
- Short sentences when possible
- No jargon or buzzwords
- Conversational but professional

## QUALITY CHECKS

Before showing any changes, verify:
1. ✓ Only text content was changed
2. ✓ HTML structure is intact
3. ✓ No CSS was modified
4. ✓ All tags are properly closed
5. ✓ File references use @ symbol
6. ✓ Changes match the provided copy exactly

---

## WHEN IN DOUBT

- Ask specific questions
- Show me what you're uncertain about
- Don't make assumptions about intent
- Propose options if multiple approaches possible

---

## MODEL PREFERENCES

- Use Claude Sonnet (or best available model) for all changes
- Prioritize accuracy over speed
- Double-check text replacements for typos

---

## REMEMBER

This is a content update project, not a redesign. The template structure, styling, and functionality should remain completely untouched. We're just swapping the placeholder text with our actual copy.

If I ask you to do something that violates these rules, remind me of the constraints and suggest an alternative approach.
